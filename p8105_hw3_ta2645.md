# Problem 1

## Instacart

Most popular aisles and number of items ordered:

``` r
data("instacart")
n_aisle = 
  instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))

head(n_aisle, 5)
```

    ## # A tibble: 5 Ã— 2
    ##   aisle                           n
    ##   <chr>                       <int>
    ## 1 fresh vegetables           150609
    ## 2 fresh fruits               150473
    ## 3 packaged vegetables fruits  78493
    ## 4 yogurt                      55240
    ## 5 packaged cheese             41699
